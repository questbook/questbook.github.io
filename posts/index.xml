      <description>Can you explain from a user experience standpoint how a smart contract wallet is different &amp;amp; better from metamask? Smart contract wallets are not a replacement of Metamask. The fundamental to understand here is that in ethereum and crypto, code is a first class citizen. You can write code that acts and behaves on behalf of a user. In contrast, this is not the case in web2 where humans are first class citizens and code is always blocked away with tps throttling, captchas etc.</description>
