      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re committed to making permissionless work a reality to help millions of builders and contributors increase their economic mobility.
The Questbook team has been working with the top DAOs and protocols to fine tune the process and deployed the first version of the workflow tool. But there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work to be done. We need your help.
There are a few broad directions we&amp;rsquo;re actively working on
Delegated domain allocation Problems  A single capital allocation (grants/bounties/investments) program has numerous blind spots and will miss lot of opportunities A single capital allocation program will result in burn-out of the folks running them Voting on all grant and bounties is an unreasonable ask from the community, and inefficient for the community  Solution space  Multiple domain allocators - who run capital allocation programs in their domain of expertise All the domain allocators have full ownership of how to run the program, no community voting on every decision Full transparency of performance and direction, community members can initiate a no-confidence motion upon poor performance  Contribute Learn more  Minimum Grants DAO with Maximum Community Participation I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in the way grants are run today  Participate Permissionless Work Improvment Proposals Forum - Delegated Domain Allocation</description>

      <title>Gasless Smart Contract Wallet Implementation</title>
      <link>https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/gasless-smart-contract-wallet-implementation/</link>

      <description>This implementation borrows from EIP 1776 and EIP 4337. However, simplified for a the use case of letting a dapp onboard a user to their platform without having to pay for the gas or install a wallet.
Assumptions  The Dapp that wants to subsidize the gas for the user is a central entity, ie. the relayer. We&amp;rsquo;re not decentralizing the relayer network as proposed in EIP 1613  User identification - OAuth A centralized relayer can subsidize the gas of the end user.</description>

      <title>Seaport and Protocol Ownership</title>
      <link>https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/seaport-protocol-ownership/</link>

      <description>Originally :  
The recent OpenSea launch of seaport is a masterstroke.
Web3 moats are in composability traction; not (just) user traction.
Firstly, the protocol launch context
https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/introducing-seaport-protocol/?amp=1
https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport
Why give away everything for free, when you could have milked profits by owning the IP?
OpenSea words the Seaport as a way to build with the community and support a generation of builders and developers. Though it may sound altruistic, it is actually in the best interest of their business to do this.</description>

      <title>Gasless Smart Contract Wallet</title>
      <link>https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/gasless-smart-contract-wallet/</link>

      <description>Most wallets are designed for DeFi. A wallet that works for your DApp, probably needs to be designed ground up.
Gasless I think gaslessness is an under explored opportunity in web3 - a way to interact with onchain contracts without having to pay the gas. L2s like Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon have low gas fees - why don&amp;rsquo;t we just use a cheaper chain for on-chain transactions/interactions? If you think gaslessness is about gas prices, you&amp;rsquo;re mistaken.</description>

      <title>Minimum Grants DAO with Maximum Community Participation</title>
      <link>https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/</link>

      <description>Community participation is wrongly interpretted as vote on everything. Many grants DAO use the same model to run, what becomes, an inefficient grants program. Here, after working with a dozen grant programs in the ecosystem, I&amp;rsquo;ll lay out how you can have a grant program that is both efficient and community driven.
Delegated Capital Allocators The grant program must be divided into specialized grant programs, each with its own budget. This could be for various verticals like NFTs projects, DeFi, Infrastructure, Dev Tooling etc.</description>

      <description>800 builders on Terra have lost their livelihood - in the last 1 week. Builders are losing trust on betting their careers on a chain. Terra’s collapse has downstream effects that will affect every ecosystem. Developers are leaving, leave alone attracting new developers. Now is the time to focus. If you don’t involve the community to build trust among developers - the grant program will be unfruitful.
We’ve studied various successful and unsuccessful grant programs.</description>

      <description>Questbook is in the business of increasing economic mobility of builders. We&amp;rsquo;re innovating on the future of work on multiple dimensions. Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline the various things that we&amp;rsquo;re launching in Q3 2022.
Permissionless work An Uber driver can get work on tap of a button, but the best of the best developers cannot get work on tap of a button. How do we fix that? In enabling this future, we first need a marketplace of capital for building and builders - for seamless matching to be possible.</description>

      <description>Originally seen on Twitter
This is a relevant time to clear some confusion around what we do at Questbook
People know us for our educational content.
We&amp;rsquo;re in the business of helping builders increase financial mobility.
This is the time to focus on builders and building, now that the dust around NFTs and DeFi hype has settled.
Our tutorials went viral, largely because there were no good crypto tutorials back when we launched in 2021.</description>

      <title>What Is Staking Non Technical</title>
      <link>https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/what-is-staking-non-technical/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/what-is-staking-non-technical/</guid>
      <description>Can you explain the economics behind the concept of staking from a non technical point of view? Sure. Different staking mechanisms have different mechanisms but they do have some similarities which I&amp;rsquo;ll touch upon. The basis behind the blockchain as in bitcoin was that you secure the blocks by computing a certain number every 10 mins (called nonce). That is 10 min of high intensity computation. The security assumption is that if you are spending $100 of electricity in doing the computation, and getting rewarded something that is worth $101, it&amp;rsquo;s profitable to do those computation aka mining.</description>

      <title>Smart Contract Wallets v/s Metamask?</title>
      <link>https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/smart-contract-wallets/</link>

      <guid>https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/smart-contract-wallets/</guid>
      <description>Can you explain from a user experience standpoint how a smart contract wallet is different &amp;amp; better from metamask? Smart contract wallets are not a replacement of Metamask. The fundamental to understand here is that in ethereum and crypto, code is a first class citizen. You can write code that acts and behaves on behalf of a user. In contrast, this is not the case in web2 where humans are first class citizens and code is always blocked away with tps throttling, captchas etc.</description>
