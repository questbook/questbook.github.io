We focus on making sure that you are able to allocate funds from your treasury to builders in a seamless manner. However, you may have personal or corporate preferences on the specific processes you want to follow.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve long maintained that since all the data is open and on-chain, anyone can build applications and customizations on top of Questbook contracts. However, with this Zapier integration we make that data and events available to you on an easy to use dashboard, that you can connect with thousands of other applications already available on zapier.</p><p>Triggers include</p><ul><li>A new grant/bounty is created</li><li>A builder applied</li><li>A review was submitted</li><li>A payout was made</li><li>And, many more &mldr;</li></ul><p>You can see the full sourcecode at <a href=https://github.com/questbook/qb-api>https://github.com/questbook/qb-api</a></p><h1 id=some-usecases>Some usecases</h1><ul><li>Create automations for financial auditing</li><li>Notify the right people when a builder applies for a grant</li><li>Update a google sheet for archiving and record keeping</li><li>Create dashboards on HubSpot for org-wide visibility</li></ul><h1 id=demo>Demo</h1><p>By <a href=https://twitter.com/richik_chanda>Richik Chanda</a></p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nGeGqmDZOU4 title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><h1 id=get-access>Get access</h1><div data-tf-widget=mgEGZuoK data-tf-iframe-props="title=Typeform" data-tf-medium=snippet style=width:100%;height:400px></div><script src=//embed.typeform.com/next/embed.js></script><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://blog.questbook.xyz/>&copy; Questbook official blog 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
