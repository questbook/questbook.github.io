Though it may sound altruistic, it is actually in the best interest of their business to do this. Everyone wins. That&rsquo;s web3.</p><p>OpenSea ofcourse is a marketplace. it&rsquo;s built on top of the erc721. In many ways OpenSea implements what the 721 standard prescribes. Launching a protocol, it takes the entire narrative from standard definition to user experience in its own hands.</p><p>Now seaport is likely to become a standard for token marketplace. Because of OpenSea itself building on these open standards. Developers around the world will innovate and build even cooler stuff on top of this protocol. They&rsquo;ll compose. When more people compose, more &ldquo;standardised&rdquo; the standard becomes. The foundations on which OpenSea was built, is getting stronger. This is critical, especially in a market of fast changing technology.</p><p>NFT itself is beginning to take various shapes and directions. OpenSea bet on NFTs being tradable assets, POAP bet on NFT as credentials, we&rsquo;re now seeing soul bound NFTs as Sybil resistance measures. All these NFT usecase ofcourse compete for the same nft standard&rsquo;s evolution.</p><p>OpenSea can&rsquo;t risk</p><ol><li>Slowing down innovation on tradable NFTs because of infighting</li><li>NFTs losing focus as a tradable asset (as in soul bound)</li></ol><p>With Seaport, OpenSea has taken the tradable NFTs & marketplace standard into its own hands.</p><p>It will define the standard, OpenSea will implement that standard and reap the rewards. Though, I&rsquo;m sure there is going to be a better way to capture the value from the seaport protocol.</p><p>But all this value is not speculative. It has already manifested in code</p><p><a href=https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/09679c4a6a81552b1f31dd14a832e300636315be/contracts/lib/BasicOrderFulfiller.sol#L634>https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/09679c4a6a81552b1f31dd14a832e300636315be/contracts/lib/BasicOrderFulfiller.sol#L634</a></p><p>Here you can see tipping already implemented in the above link.</p><p>But the discussions are happening here to make it a standard :
