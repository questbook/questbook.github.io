<p>The recent <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea">OpenSea</a> launch of seaport is a masterstroke.</p>

<p>Why give away everything for free, when you could have milked profits by owning the IP?</p>
<p>OpenSea words the Seaport as a way to build with the community and support a generation of builders and developers. Though it may sound altruistic, it is actually in the best interest of their business to do this. Everyone wins. That&rsquo;s web3.</p>
<p>OpenSea ofcourse is a marketplace. it&rsquo;s built on top of the erc721. In many ways OpenSea implements what the 721 standard prescribes. Launching a protocol, it takes the entire narrative from standard definition to user experience in its own hands.</p>
<p>Now seaport is likely to become a standard for token marketplace. Because of OpenSea itself building on these open standards. Developers around the world will innovate and build even cooler stuff on top of this protocol. They&rsquo;ll compose. When more people compose, more &ldquo;standardised&rdquo; the standard becomes. The foundations on which OpenSea was built, is getting stronger. This is critical, especially in a market of fast changing technology.</p>
<p>NFT itself is beginning to take various shapes and directions. OpenSea bet on NFTs being tradable assets, POAP bet on NFT as credentials, we&rsquo;re now seeing soul bound NFTs as Sybil resistance measures. All these NFT usecase ofcourse compete for the same nft standard&rsquo;s evolution.</p>
<p>OpenSea can&rsquo;t risk</p>
<ol>
<li>Slowing down innovation on tradable NFTs because of infighting</li>
<li>NFTs losing focus as a tradable asset (as in soul bound)</li>
</ol>
<p>With Seaport, OpenSea has taken the tradable NFTs &amp; marketplace standard into its own hands.</p>
<p>It will define the standard, OpenSea will implement that standard and reap the rewards. Though, I&rsquo;m sure there is going to be a better way to capture the value from the seaport protocol.</p>
<p>But all this value is not speculative. It has already manifested in code</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/09679c4a6a81552b1f31dd14a832e300636315be/contracts/lib/BasicOrderFulfiller.sol#L634">https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport/blob/09679c4a6a81552b1f31dd14a832e300636315be/contracts/lib/BasicOrderFulfiller.sol#L634</a></p>
<p>Here you can see tipping already implemented in the above link.</p>
<p>But the discussions are happening here to make it a standard :
<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4393">https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4393</a> (EIP 4393)</p>
<p>EIP 4xxx are likely to go through in about 2-3 years</p>
<p>By launching their own protocol, OpenSea has</p>
<ol>
<li>Shortcircuited innovation by 2-3 years on multiple axes</li>
<li>Taken control of the standards</li>
<li>Consolidating the tech it is building on, by inviting composability</li>
<li>Opening up to new forms of value capture at protocol level</li>
</ol>
<p>Web3 is about composability.</p>
