Storage is one of the most important parts of the tech-stack.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t run our own centralized database or servers. All the data that on the <em>grants & bounties</em> tool - including creating grants, developers applying, reviewers reviewing - are all data that is stored on chain or on decentralized storage.</p><p>We initially started with IPFS as our data store. As our product aged, we realized we were losing a lot of our data. We were able to pin it on the servers that we spun up, but they weren&rsquo;t getting pinned on other servers. So either the data was unavailable or the data access became incredibly slow - rendering the product almost unusable.</p><p>That is when we realized, thanks to the amazing team at Protocol Labs, that a more efficient way to store and retrieve such data is using Filecoin to make data available all the time.</p><p>We have migrated to Filecoin using Web3.storage and our product feels much snappier and easier to use! Excited to see massive strides in infrastructure improvements in Web3!</p><iframe width=560 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/u8hDMGkUa-U title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0 allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://blog.questbook.xyz/>&copy; Questbook official blog 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
