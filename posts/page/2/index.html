However, simplified for a the use case of letting a dapp onboard a user to their platform without having to pay for the gas or install a wallet.
Assumptions The Dapp that wants to subsidize the gas for the user is a central entity, ie. the relayer. We&rsquo;re not decentralizing the relayer network as proposed in EIP 1613 User identification - OAuth A centralized relayer can subsidize the gas of the end user.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/podcasts/ class="link black dim">Podcasts : Tech Deepdives</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Tech Deepdives Bringing in technical founders and talking about the technical intricacies of their products.

Why give away everything for free, when you could have milked profits by owning the IP?
OpenSea words the Seaport as a way to build with the community and support a generation of builders and developers. Though it may sound altruistic, it is actually in the best interest of their business to do this.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/gasless-smart-contract-wallet/ class="link black dim">Gasless Smart Contract Wallet</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Most wallets are designed for DeFi. A wallet that works for your DApp, probably needs to be designed ground up.
Gasless I think gaslessness is an under explored opportunity in web3 - a way to interact with onchain contracts without having to pay the gas. L2s like Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon have low gas fees - why don&rsquo;t we just use a cheaper chain for on-chain transactions/interactions? If you think gaslessness is about gas prices, you&rsquo;re mistaken.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/ class="link black dim">Minimum Grants DAO with Maximum Community Participation</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Community participation is wrongly interpretted as vote on everything. Many grants DAO use the same model to run, what becomes, an inefficient grants program. Here, after working with a dozen grant programs in the ecosystem, I&rsquo;ll lay out how you can have a grant program that is both efficient and community driven.
Delegated Capital Allocators The grant program must be divided into specialized grant programs, each with its own budget. This could be for various verticals like NFTs projects, DeFi, Infrastructure, Dev Tooling etc.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/i-dont-believe-in-grants/ class="link black dim">I Don't Believe in Grants (the way they're run today)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">800 builders on Terra have lost their livelihood - in the last 1 week. Builders are losing trust on betting their careers on a chain. Terra’s collapse has downstream effects that will affect every ecosystem. Developers are leaving, leave alone attracting new developers. Now is the time to focus. If you don’t involve the community to build trust among developers - the grant program will be unfruitful.

This is a relevant time to clear some confusion around what we do at Questbook
People know us for our educational content.
We&rsquo;re in the business of helping builders increase financial mobility.
This is the time to focus on builders and building, now that the dust around NFTs and DeFi hype has settled.
Our tutorials went viral, largely because there were no good crypto tutorials back when we launched in 2021.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/what-is-staking-non-technical/ class="link black dim">What Is Staking Non Technical</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Can you explain the economics behind the concept of staking from a non technical point of view? Sure. Different staking mechanisms have different mechanisms but they do have some similarities which I&rsquo;ll touch upon. The basis behind the blockchain as in bitcoin was that you secure the blocks by computing a certain number every 10 mins (called nonce). That is 10 min of high intensity computation. The security assumption is that if you are spending $100 of electricity in doing the computation, and getting rewarded something that is worth $101, it&rsquo;s profitable to do those computation aka mining.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/smart-contract-wallets/ class="link black dim">Smart Contract Wallets v/s Metamask?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Can you explain from a user experience standpoint how a smart contract wallet is different & better from metamask? Smart contract wallets are not a replacement of Metamask. The fundamental to understand here is that in ethereum and crypto, code is a first class citizen. You can write code that acts and behaves on behalf of a user. In contrast, this is not the case in web2 where humans are first class citizens and code is always blocked away with tps throttling, captchas etc.</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class="page-item disabled"><a aria-disabled=true aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button tabindex=-1><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://blog.questbook.xyz/>&copy; Questbook official blog 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
