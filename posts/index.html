Context Foundations and DAOs grow the ecosystems via grants, bounties, partnerships, BD etc. These utilize funds from the community allocation, aka the treasury. With Questbook, these processes can be run on-chain - giving complete transparency and accountability to the community on where and why funds are being deployed.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/questbook-invite-links/ class="link black dim">Questbook Invite Links: The web3 OTP</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The Problem Web3 is a nascent stack, and a major challenge dApps like QuestBook face is educating users about web3 terminology and delivering products that are easy to use products as well as decentralised.
One of QuestBook&rsquo;s workflows allowed DAOs to invite their team members to their organisation on QuestBook. However, to add the user to their organisation on chain, the organisation owner had to ask their team for their respective wallet addresses &ndash; which can feel unnatural, since wallet addresses have no easy-to-remember pattern like email addresses do.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/delegated-domain-allocators/ class="link black dim">Questbook proposal for Delegated Domain Allocators</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Grants is an effective way to reward contributors to the ecosystem, and make the protocol more valuable. We must identify active members of our community to run our grant program rather than a centralized committee.
If you are actively contributing to the ecosystem, we believe you should also be allocated a budget to disburse as grants - to attract the highest quality builders.
Foundation money should move as close as possible to the builder, especially during the bear market.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/questbook-zapier-integration/ class="link black dim">Questbook Zapier Integration : A crashcourse in composability</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Questbook is an unopinionated multisig safe for allocating funds to builders.

Questbook is completely decentralized. We don&rsquo;t own any proprietary data or run centralized servers. Even the data is either on-chain or stored on IPFS/Filecoin and delivered via Graph protocol.
Questbook itself has been built composing on various other protocols that came before us.

We&rsquo;ve previously talked a lot about the SACI Architecture for software applications. Storage is one of the most important parts of the tech-stack.
We don&rsquo;t run our own centralized database or servers. All the data that on the grants & bounties tool - including creating grants, developers applying, reviewers reviewing - are all data that is stored on chain or on decentralized storage.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/posts/add-a-chain/ class="link black dim">Your chain not supported on Questbook?
